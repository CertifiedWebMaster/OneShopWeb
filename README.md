All E-Com Plus stores should include Bootstrap 4.3 theme to improve compatibility between brand colors, store template and third party widgets, keeping as possible a consistent visual identity.

To create a new template, you SHOULD use as possible the default bootstrap components, and/or adapt them to mirror your theme visual identity.

To create a new widget, you MUST use bootstrap components the maximum as possible, to follow the theme and store brand visual identity, you should also use utilities and avoid creating custom CSS.
